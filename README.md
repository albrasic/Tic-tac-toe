# Tic-tac-toe
The tic-tac-toe game for a classroom setting. It is based on a chat application by Miguel Grinberg. It requires that all python packages listed in the files "requirements.txt" and "events.py", located inside the folder app/main, be installed by running the command pip3 "package name". Similar to the chat application, this game is launched by running python3 chat.py, inside the top folder, and then accessing the webpage at http://localhost:5000
